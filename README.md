# Nv98-InventorySystem
This is my own version of an inventory manager addon for godot / redot / blazium
Because i wasn't satified with how Gloot, Wyvern or Espresso bit's inventory system worked.

For now (17/04/2025) I'll be posting just some updates. When the final version shows up I wont maintain the code for further updates, so dont expect this to be updated often.
